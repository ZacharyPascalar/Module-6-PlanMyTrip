# WeatherPy: PlanMyTrip
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to add weather trends as an aspect of the PlanMyTrip app to allow travelers another layer of information into place they may like to go to. The package comprises a weather database, vacation search, and an itinerary for possible road trips within a region.  

## Weather Database
The weather database is a compilation of the max temperature, humidity, cloud cover, wind speed, and overall description of 748 cities around the world. The data was obtained through the Open Weather Map API in and with Python.

## Vacation Search
The vacation search allows travelers to filter cities by their desired temperature range; for this particular example, the range was between 60 and 70 degrees Fahrenheit.
